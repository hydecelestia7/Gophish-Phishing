![Gophish Logo](images/Aspose.Words.0146a2c1-24ea-4e7c-82f0-c7fc27024e69.001.png)

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and executing **phishing attack simulations** using **Gophish**, an open-source phishing framework. The objective is to **enhance cybersecurity awareness** and evaluate an organization's resilience against phishing attacks through controlled simulations.

## üöÄ Why Conduct Phishing Simulations?

Phishing remains one of the most prevalent **cybersecurity threats**, often leading to:

- **Credential theft**
- **Financial fraud**
- **Data breaches**

Despite advancements in **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and **email filtering solutions**, the **human element** remains a critical vulnerability. Conducting phishing simulations helps organizations:

‚úÖ **Educate employees** on phishing tactics and social engineering methods.
‚úÖ **Assess security awareness** through real-world phishing scenarios.
‚úÖ **Identify weaknesses** in existing cybersecurity defenses.
‚úÖ **Strengthen incident response** by reinforcing best practices for recognizing and reporting suspicious emails.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Sign up on Railway** using your GitHub account.
2. **Deploy Gophish** using the [one-click template](https://railway.app/).
3. **Monitor deployment logs** to retrieve admin credentials.
4. **Access the Gophish dashboard** via the generated Railway domain (`xxx.up.railway.app`).

### Option 2: Deploying Gophish via a Forked Repository

For a more **customizable** setup, deploy Gophish using a forked repository on Railway.

#### Steps to Deploy

1. **Fork the Gophish repository** on GitHub.

2. **Create a new Railway project** and deploy from the forked repository.
3. **Modify the `config.json` file** to include:
   - Setting `listen_url` to `0.0.0.0:3333` for external access.
   - Disabling `use_tls` (Railway manages TLS automatically).
   - Adding the **Railway domain** under `trusted_origins`.
4. **Commit changes** and redeploy the application.
5. **Access Gophish** via the Railway-assigned domain.
